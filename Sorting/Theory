Sorting in Python:
==================

> sort()
    > Works only for list
    > sorts in place

> sorted()
    > works for any iterables
    > Does not modifies the passed container. Returns a new list of sorted items

> Both use Tim sort and both are stable
 Tim sort is a hybrid algorithm that use the combination of merge sort and insertion sort internally.
 Worst case time complexity is O(n log n)
