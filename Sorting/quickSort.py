Introduction:
==============
1) Divide and Conquer Algorithm
2) Worst case time : O(n^2)
3) Despite this it is considered faster because of the following:
    a) In-Place
    b) Cache- friendly
    c) Average case is O(nlog(n))
    d) Tail recursive
4) Partition is key function(naive, Lomuto, Hoars)
